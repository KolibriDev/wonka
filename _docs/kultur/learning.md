# Guidelines for attending conferences and seminars
The main guideline is based on Reinventing Organizations. 
Anyone can decide for him/herself to attend to a conference or a seminar, given a discussion with relevant roles, namely finance and learning, and the closest colleagues for scheduling purposes. 
Kolibri pays: 

* Conference and seminar fees 
* All travel cost (flight, to and from airport, to and from venue/hotel, ...) 
* Hotel 
* Absence from work (summer vacation not needed) 

Notes: 

* Conference/seminar days count no more than 8 hours (1 day) each, regardless of whether it's a weekend or not 
* Travel days count as half days (4 hours) each, unless it's a very long or strange travel 
* Daily allowance, i.e. food and such, is not paid by Kolibri 
* Cost transparence - fill out the google doc (General Company Circle/Learning and Pet Projects/Kostnaður-ráðstefnur-námskeið)
